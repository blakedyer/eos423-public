\noindent In this assignment, you will expand your 1D sedimentary transport model to simulate the growth, build-up and demise of carbonate platforms. You will also explore how to build age models, and use them to interpret geochemical time series. We have provided two Jupyter notebooks with code to help you (one relevant to modifying the transport model, the other to building age models).
