build models that numerically solve partial differential equations
use your own models to develop intuition about the internal and external controls on stratigraphic architecture
develop an understanding of the processes that lead to correlative surfaces
consider the predictable patterns of when and where time is missing in basin
use your understanding of process to interpret modeled and real stratigraphic data and infer the past
build age models for stratigraphic data while considering uncertainty
use time series analysis to look for cycles and patterns in stratigraphic data
develop your scientific writing skills focusing on clear and precise communication
consider processes that lead to differences between siliciclastic filled basins and carbonate filled basins
