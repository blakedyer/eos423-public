  \textbf{EVALUATION}
\end{center}

This course will use the \href{https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies}{official UVic standard grading scale}. Your final grade will be determined by your scores on in-class mid-term exams, lab write-ups, and a programming lab exam. There is no final exam.

\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ lr }
			Lecture                     & 40\%       \\
			\hline
			~~~Assignment presentations  & 10\%~~~~~~ \\
			~~~Mid-term 1 (Feb 13, week 6)  & 15\%~~~~~~ \\
			~~~Mid-term 2 (Apr 3, week 13)  & 15\%~~~~~~ \\
			Laboratory                  & 60\%       \\
			\hline
			~~~7 Lab write-ups    & 60\%~~~~~~  \\
			% ~~~1 Lab exam (Mar 14, week 10)    & 20\%~~~~~~  \\
		\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Students must pass ($>50\%$) both the lab and lecture portion of this course to pass the course. In other words, a 100\% average on the labs and a 49\% average on the in class exams will result in a failing final grade (and vice versa).}

  \textbf{COURSE POLICIES}
\end{center}

If you need academic accommodation to address barriers to your education, please register with the Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL) as soon as possible. We work with the CAL to create a learning environment that is equitable, inclusive, and usable for all.

\textbf{POLICY: CLASS CONDUCT}

Please follow the latest provincial and University guidelines with regard to COVID-19 protocols: \href{https://www.uvic.ca/covid19/index.php}{UVic COVID-19 information} and \href{https://www.uvic.ca/covid19/health-safety/index.php#ipn-if-you-re-sick}{what to do if you are ill}. No materials from the course may be redistributed without written permission from the instructors (e.g., no posting of materials to sharing websites). If we are required to meet on Zoom, you should remain muted during lecture unless you are speaking to the class or instructors.

\textbf{POLICY: LATE/MISSED ASSIGNMENTS OR EXAMINATIONS}

Students are required to complete all exams to recieve a final grade in the course. If you must miss the an exam for a valid reason (illness, accident, family emergency etc.), you must notify the instructor as soon as possible, and you may be asked to provide documentation to support your request. If you miss an exam \textbf{with a valid excuse}, we will arrange a make up exam.

If a student does not sit an exam, they will be assigned a grade of \textbf{N} regardless of their performance in other elements of the course. A grade of \textbf{N} is a failing grade and will be scored as a zero in the calculation of the students CGPA. The maximum percentage grade that can be assigned for a student achieving a \textbf{N} grade is 49\%. 

%The general approach to late submissions of lab assignments is a 10\% grade penalty per day. Late assignments will not be accepted after marked assignments have been returned to others. However, if you know that you will miss a deadline due to a personal emergency, please let your lab instructors know as soon as possible and we will do our best to work with you to find a solution.
Assignment due dates are considered \textbf{hard deadlines}, except under extra-ordinary circumstances. If you have a known conflict that will make completing an assignment impossible, please notify the instructors well in advance of the due date.

\textbf{POLICY: ATTENDANCE}

You are expected to be present and active in the lectures. I will not formally track participation in lecture, but from past experience I know that the assignments will be significantly easier to complete and exam scores are higher for those who attend and participate in lecture and laboratory. If you will miss a lab for medical or other valid reasons, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. Recall that \textbf{you must pass the lab to pass the course}.

\textbf{POLICY: ACADEMIC INTEGRITY}

It is every student's responsibility to be aware of the university's \href{https://web.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/info/regulations/academic-integrity.html}{policies on ccademic integrity}, including policies on cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized use of an editor, multiple submission, and aiding others to cheat. 

If you have any questions or doubts, you can ask your course instructor or the \href{https://uvic.ca/learningandteaching/cac}{Centre for Academic Communication}.

\begin{center}
  \textbf{COURSE FEEDBACK}
\end{center}
\smallskip
\vspace*{-.6em}
I value your feedback on this course. Towards the end of term, as in all other courses at UVic, you will have the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey regarding your learning experience (CES). \textbf{The survey is vital for providing feedback} to me regarding the course and my teaching, as well as to help the department improve the overall program for students in the future. The survey is accessed online and can be done on your laptop, tablet, or mobile device. I will remind you and provide you with more detailed information nearer the time but please be thinking about this important activity during the course.
